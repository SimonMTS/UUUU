          INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY

          Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
          Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.

                         

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
          vehicle.
          The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
          Man.

           2.

                         

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
          Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
          briefcase.

                         

                          DRIVER
           He wasn't alone.
          CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
          Pavel.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You don't get to bring friends.

           DR. PAVEL

                          (SHAKEN)
           They are not my friends.

                          DRIVER
           Don't worry, no charge for them.

                          CIA MAN
           Why would I want them?

                          DRIVER
           They were trying to grab your
           prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
           mercenary. The masked man.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (EXCITED)
           Bane?
          The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

          The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.
          CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.

                          CIA MAN
           What are you doing in the middle of
           my operation?

           3.

                         
          Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
           The flight plan I just filed with
           the Agency lists me, my men, and
           Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
           you.
          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

                         

                          CIA MAN

           FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
           MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)

           SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.

           PAVEL?!

                         
          Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
          Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

                          CIA MAN

           HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

           TRY NEXT?!

                         
          The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

                          CIA MAN

           TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

           WEAR THE MASK?!

                         
          The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
          man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

                          CIA MAN

           LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

                         

           THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
           Or he's wondering why someone would
           shoot a man before throwing him out
           of an aeroplane.

                         
          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

                          CIA MAN
           Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
           talk. Who are you?

                         

                          THIRD PRISONER
           We are nothing. We are the dirt
           beneath your feet. And no one cared
           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

           4.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Who we are does not matter. What
           matters is our plan.

                          CIA MAN

                          (FASCINATED)
           If I pull this off, will you die?

                          BANE
           It would be extremely painful.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You're a big guy -

                          BANE
           For you.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (UNNERVED)
           Was being caught part of your plan?

                          BANE
           Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
           offer in favor of yours. We had to
           know what he told you about us.

           DR. PAVEL
           Nothing! I said nothing!

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Why not just ask him?

                          BANE
           He would not have told us.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You have methods.

                          BANE
           Him, I need healthy. You present no
           such problem.
          CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
          tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
          looming over it, dangerously close...

           5.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The plane lurches. The noise is building.

                          SERGEANT
           Sir?

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Well congratulations, you got
           yourselves caught. What's the next
           step of your master plan?

                         

                          BANE
           Crashing this plane...

                         

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
          tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
          side...

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
          above. CIA Man looks at Bane.

                          BANE

                          (RISING)
           With no survivors.
          A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
          outside the window. Bang -

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
          grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
          to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
          unnaturally.

                         

          INT. COCKPIT, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward.

           6.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
          legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
          Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
          neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
          plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
          Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
          him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

                         

                         

          EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

          The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
          helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
          opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
          gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
          by Dr. Pavel.

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
          swinging out as the tail explodes.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
          Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
          A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
          seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
          horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
          drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
          body...

                         
          An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
          out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

           7.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Friend. They expect one of us in
           the wreckage.
          The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

                         

                          HOODED MAN 2
           Have we started the fire?

                          BANE

                          (NODS)
           The fire rises.
          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

                         

                          BANE
           Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
           fear...
          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

                         

                          BANE
           That comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
          Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
          and we -
